## Description
The OutputRange program takes two integers as input and outputs a sequence of numbers starting from the first integer and incrementing by 5, up to (and including) the second integer. If the second integer is smaller than the first, it will notify the user that the second integer cannot be less than the first.

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/EMK2473/OutputRange.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd OutputRange 
```
- Compile the OutputRange.java file: 
```Java
- javac OutputRange.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java OutputRange
```

## Application Usage
Once the program is running, you will be prompted to input two integers. If the second integer is greater than or equal to the first, the program will print numbers starting from the first and increment by 5 until it reaches or exceeds the second integer. Example:

Input: 
```Java
10 30 
```
Output: 
```Java
10 15 20 25 30 
```

If the second integer is smaller than the first, the output will be:  
```Java
Second integer can't be less than the first.
```

## Test Commands
Test the program with a variety of input values, including cases where the second integer is smaller than the first, to ensure the correct behavior.
